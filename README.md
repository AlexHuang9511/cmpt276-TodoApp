## Retrospective

This was most of our first time using GitHub's version control in a group setting so there were some troubles we ran into. Through this, we have learned a lot about the git system and how it operates. Also, this is our first time working with Koltin and the android ecosystem. I think for a basic to-do list app, our group has done pretty well. QA was done every time a pull request was made. This ensured that our main branch was always working. 

## Running the App

Currently the app is still under development so no final build version has been made. 
We are running and testing the app with the help of the android emulator in Android Studio. 


To run the app, clone the repo and open Android Studio and run the app there (with "Run 'app'").
